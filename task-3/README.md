# Exercise 3: Serve an HTML Form and Handle POST Request Using Core http Module
## Goal: Serve a form from a static HTML file located in the `views/` directory, accessible at `/books/new`, and handle form submissions at `POST /books`.

## Steps:
### 1. Create the HTML Form
Place an HTML file (`new-book.html`) inside a `/views` folder with a simple form to capture book details (title and author).

### 2. Create a GET route for `/books/new` that serves the form HTML file:


### 3. Create a POST route for `/books` to handle form submissions and log the data.

## Folder Structure
```
views/
└── new-book.html
.

```
