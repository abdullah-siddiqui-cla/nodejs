# Exercise 1: Basic HTTP Server Listening on Connections
## Goal: Set up a basic server using Nodeâ€™s HTTP core module and listen for incoming connections.

## Steps:
### 1. Create the Server:
Use the http core module to create a server that listens on port 3000.
For each incoming request, log the request method and URL.

### 2. Respond to Requests:
Respond with a simple message, e.g., "Welcome to My Node.js Server!" for every request.
